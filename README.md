Step 1:

Idea 1: Madidi 
* An interactive marketplace for farmers to sell their goods to local buyers in the app

Idea 2: Digo
* A translation app for indigenous languages that translates languages in real time.

Idea 3: Talk
* A TikTok-like social media platform where people can post 15 second audio clips to the app and share with friends.

Step 2:

Madidi
* Mobile: Delivery and GPS functionality makes the app well fitting for mobile
* Story: This story is very compelling because of its potential usefulness for impoversihed communities of local farmers
* Market: People from all around the world (anyone who gets groceries) could use this app. 
* Habit: Anyone can open the app when they're hungry. It's like the UberEats for local produce, making it very usable.
* Scope: It will not be too hard to finish the static aspects of the app's UI. The simple version of this app is still pretty interesting. 


Digo
* Mobile: Not very uniquely mobile. A translation app could easily be a website.
* Story: The story behind this app is an effort to preserve indigienous languges, which has clear value in today's world especially in relevant humanitarian crises. 
* Market: The scale of this user base is very large as anyone who speaks and indigenous language or works with those populations could utilize it.
* Habit: Not the most addictive since it's usually single use per day.
* Scope: This app is quite hard to build. The simple version is incredibly basic, but to actually make it functional, I have to use Meta's LLM they use for research which is not well dcumented for indigenous languages.
